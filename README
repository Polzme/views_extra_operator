Informations:
-------------
This is my first Views module, I'm just pretty new in Views module hacking !
This is a very simple module who add new operators to view's arguments.
It can be very useful.
Currently, text fields(CCK also) and numeric fields are working.

The Future:
-----------
I'm planning to add date fields soon.
I'm planning to provides hooks to alter the operators and the argument itself.

Miscellaneous:
