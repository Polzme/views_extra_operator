Informations:
-------------
This is a very simple module who add new operators to view's arguments.
Currently, text fields and numeric fields are working, CCK fields too.
It allows you to use LIKE, NOT LIKE(etc etc...) instead of the default '=' for argument handling.

The Future:
-----------
I'm planning to add date fields soon.
I'm planning to provides hooks to alter the operators and the argument itself.

Miscellaneous:
