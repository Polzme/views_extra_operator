Informations:
-------------
This is a very simple module who add new operators to view's arguments and/or sort fields.
It allows you to use LIKE, NOT LIKE(etc etc...) instead of the default '=' for fields handling.
You can also preprocess the field with SQL functions like LENGTH(), etc etc. (see the list below).

Supported SQL Functions:
------------------------
- Ascii
- Format
- Hex
- Length
- Locate
- Lower
- Oct
- Ord
- Reverse
- Right
- Rpad
- Soundex
- Substring
- Substring Index
- Unhex
- Upper

Supported operators:
---------------------
- Is equal to
- Is not equal to
- Contains
- Contains any words
- Contains all words
- Start with
- Does not start with
- Ends with
- Does not end with
- Does not contain
- Is greater
- Is greater or equal
- Is lesser
- Is lesser or equal
- Is different
- Is between
- Is not between

The Future:
-----------
I'm currently working on a Views 3 version.
I'm planning to add date fields soon.
I'm planning to provides hooks to alter the operators and the argument itself.
