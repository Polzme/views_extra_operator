Informations:
-------------
This is a very simple module who add new operators to view's arguments.
Currently, text fields and numeric fields are working, CCK fields too.
It allows you to use LIKE, NOT LIKE(etc etc...) instead of the default '=' for argument handling.

Supported operations:
---------------------
- Is equal to
- Is not equal to
- Contains
- Contains any words
- Contains all words
- Start with
- Does not start with
- Ends with
- Does not end with
- Does not contain
- Argument length greater
- Argument length greater or equal
- Argument length lesser
- Argument length lesser or equal
- Argument length different
- Argument length is between
- Argument length is not between

The Future:
-----------
I'm planning to add date fields soon.
I'm planning to provides hooks to alter the operators and the argument itself.
